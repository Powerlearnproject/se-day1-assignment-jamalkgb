#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices. Its essential for creating high quality software that meets the needs of the users and is easy to maintain.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) In 1948; Grace Hopper developed the first compiler which translates human-readable code into machine code
2) In 1957: FORTRAN, the first high-level programming language is released.
3) In 1960s: The term "software engineering" is coined

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Planning - This involves defining the software's purpose and scope.
2) Requirements Analysis - This seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users.
3) Design - This involves buiding the framework which is usually the software's functionality and aesthetic.
4) Coding - The engineers and developers converts the software design into tangible code guided by coding guidelines.
5) Testing - This involvesthrorough examination of the software for any bugs that slipped during coding.
6) Deployment - This is where the software is presented to the users by pushing to the production environment.
7) Maintenance - The primary focus of this phase is to adapt to the changing needs of the users evolving requirements

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving on to the next step while agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between crossfunctional teams. A scenario where waterfall would be appropriate is where the functionality of the next module is dependent on the functionality of the first module, e.g CRM, HRM, POS, etc. A scenario where Agile is used is large scale projects such as technology products like KRA Simba platform
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) A sofware developer designs and builds computer programs that power mobile devices, desktop computers and even cars. Software developers design programs, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools. 
b) The QA engineer analyzes and clarifies requirements with a customer or a business analyst, plans the process of testing, writes test cases where he tests the scripts and conducts functional testing. Any problems areas identified are added to a tracking system and discussed with developers for appropriate fixes.
c) A project manager in a software engineering team's role is to ensure that the software project meets deadlines, stays within budget and adheres to quality standards. They also assign tasks, evaluate their team's performance and provide guidance throughout the software development process. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs improve efficiency by providing tools like syntax highlighhting, auto-completion and project management features. They also reduce manual tasks, decrease debugging time, and offer essential code management functionalities. VCS allows developers to track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and revert to earlier versions of their code if necessary. Examples of IDE is Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ and Netbeans. Examples of VCS is Github, Gitlab, AWS CodeCommit and Netbeans.   

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1) Growing customer demands
2) Time Constraints
3) Limited Infrastructure
4) Limited Resources
5) Providing complete security to the software applications
6) Misinterpreted requirements
7) Adapting to the latest technology
8) Working with other developer's code

Strategies to overcome these challenges
1) Simplify software systems and make it easy to understand and manage
2) Use software testing and quality assurance techniques to ensure the quality of software systems and conduct code reviews to identify and fix issues early on
3) Use Agile development and scrum plan to plan and manage work effectively
4) Contimously learn and explore new technologies and programming languages to stay current
5) Use collaboration tools like version control systems to facilitate effective collaboration among team members
6) Use debugging tools and techniques to simplify the debugging process and make it more efficient. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.The main goal is to verify that each unit performs as expected. This type of testing helps identify bugs at an early stage, ensuring that individual pieces of code work correctly before they are integrated into larger systems.
b) Integration testing examines the interaction between different units or modules of the software. It focuses on ensuring that combined parts work together as intended.The goal is to identify issues that may arise when units are combined, such as interface mismatches, data format errors, or incorrect API calls.
c) System testing involves testing the complete and integrated software application as a whole. It verifies that the entire system meets the specified requirements. The main objective is to validate the system's overall behavior and ensure it functions correctly in its entirety, covering all the functional and non-functional requirements.
d) Acceptance testing is conducted to determine whether the software is ready for release. It is usually performed by the end-users or clients to verify that the software meets their needs and requirements. The goal is to ensure that the software is acceptable for delivery and meets the business requirements and user expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This involves creating input instructions or queries to guide AI systems in producing desired outputs or responses. The effictiveness of AI models depends significantly on the quality of the prompts they receive. Poorly designed prompts can lead to irrelevant, ambiguous, or incorrect outputs, whereas well-crafted prompts can enhance the accuracy and relevance of the AI's response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a Vague Prompt can be "Write an email introduction" This can be improved by saying "Write an enthusiastic yet professional email introduction aimed at a prospect in the tech industry using your expertise in natural language processing." With the latter I am equipping the AI with the crucial input data that enable it to craft a message that's on point.
